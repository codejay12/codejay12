##  About Me

I'm a Data & Applied Scientist with 2.6+ years of experience building ML and deep learning systems that drive meaningful impact â€” from optimizing last-mile delivery with RL, and from demand forecasting for farms to building NLP-based RAG bots and solving customer issues using conversational AI.
I believe in making things work *and* making them better â€” whether thatâ€™s squeezing a few extra percent from a model, or saving millions in operational waste.
