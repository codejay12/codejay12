## 🚀 About Me

I'm a Data & Applied Scientist with 2.5+ years of experience building ML and deep learning systems that drive meaningful impact — from optimizing last-mile delivery with RL, and from demand forecasting for farms to building NLP-based RAG bots and solving customer issues using conversational AI.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **NLP**, **forecasting**, and **optimization**, often blending data science with engineering to create deployable, scalable AI tools.

I believe in making things work *and* making them better — whether that’s squeezing a few extra percent from a model, or saving millions in operational waste.
